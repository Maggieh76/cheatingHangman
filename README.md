# cheatersHangman

A game of hangman coded in Java with a twist

Users are prompted to suggest how long the word should be, then to select how many guesses they want
User then plays the game by guessing one letter at a time

What the user does not know, is that this is an unfair game of hangman. 
The list/hash map of words that are possiblly the answer will change each time a letter is guessed to ensure the user almost never wins
